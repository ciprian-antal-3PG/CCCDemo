/**
 This service allows users to submit photos to the CCC Claim Folder by calling the method in the CCCUploadImages API class.
 Metadata is passed along with the photos. The photos can be viewed through the CCC Portal. They can be configured to be sent
 across to the insurance carrier through CCC Interfaces.
 
 Metadata includes:
 <ul>
    <li>Latitude and Longitude coordinates</li>
    <li>Timestamp UTC</li>
    <li>Image name</li>
 </ul>
 
 There is no limit to the number of times a photo can be retaken, and the Upload Photo service can be invoked each time.
 
 Note: If interfaces donâ€™t exist for the carrier they would have to be built before the photos can be sent across.
